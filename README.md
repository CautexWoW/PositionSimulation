# PositionSimulation
The purpose of this project is to be able to generate usably accurate simulations of World of warcraft boss encounters in SimulationCraft by using warcraftlogs data. 

The end goal is to be able to give the tool a WCL report, select a fight, and have it generate a Simcraft override script that will mimic the encounter.
